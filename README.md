# buffer-overflow-demo
C code to demonstrate how a buffer overflow works


## Pre-requisites

This code works in C, therefore the gcc compiler is required _(as well as an IDE)_.

[Article on how to install gcc](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-gcc-windows)

## Contents

`/src` folder contains the required code files. For running them from the terminal, make sure you work within that directory.

[Instructions.md](Instructions.md) contains the step by step guide for this demonstration, which one can follow just by replicating the steps of this file.

### Happy coding!
